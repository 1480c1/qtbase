    \brief The QPlatformScreen class provides an abstraction for visual displays.

    Many window systems has support for retrieving information on the attached displays. To be able
    to query the display QPA uses QPlatformScreen. Qt its self is most dependent on the
    physicalSize() function, since this is the function it uses to calculate the dpi to use when
    converting point sizes to pixels sizes. However, this is unfortunate on some systems, as the
    native system fakes its dpi size.

    QPlatformScreen is also used by the public api QDesktopWidget for information about the desktop.

    \brief The QPlatformScreenPageFlipper class provides an abstract interface for display buffer swapping

    Implement the displayBuffer() function to initiate a buffer swap. The
    bufferDisplayed() signal should be emitted once the buffer is actually displayed on
    the screen. The bufferReleased() signal should be emitted when the buffer data is no
    longer owned by the display hardware.
*/

/*!  \fn bool QPlatformScreenPageFlipper::displayBuffer(void *bufferHandle)

Implemented in subclasses to display the buffer referenced by \a bufferHandle directly on
the screen. Returns \c true if it is possible to display the buffer, and \c false if the
buffer cannot be displayed.

If this function returns true, the buffer must not be modified or destroyed before the
bufferReleased() signal is emitted.  The signal bufferDisplayed() is emitted when the buffer
is displayed on the screen. The two signals may be emitted in either order.

This function is allowed to block.
