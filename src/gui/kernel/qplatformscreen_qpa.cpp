    \brief The QPlatformScreen class provides an abstraction for visual displays.

    Many window systems has support for retrieving information on the attached displays. To be able
    to query the display QPA uses QPlatformScreen. Qt its self is most dependent on the
    physicalSize() function, since this is the function it uses to calculate the dpi to use when
    converting point sizes to pixels sizes. However, this is unfortunate on some systems, as the
    native system fakes its dpi size.

    QPlatformScreen is also used by the public api QDesktopWidget for information about the desktop.
