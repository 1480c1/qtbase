    \class QStringView
    \inmodule QtCore
    \since 5.10
    \brief The QStringView class provides a unified view on UTF-16 strings
    \reentrant
    \ingroup tools
    \ingroup string-processing

    QStringView provides a read-only subset of the QString API.

    A string view explicitly stores a portion of a UTF-16 string it does
    not own. It acts as an interface type to all kinds of UTF-16 string,
    without the need to construct a QString first.

    The UTF-16 string may be represented as an array (or an array-compatible
    data-structure such as QString,
    std::basic_string, etc.) of \c QChar, \c ushort, \c char16_t (on compilers that
    support C++11 Unicode strings) or (on platforms, such as Windows,
    where it is a 16-bit type) \c wchar_t.

    QStringView is designed as an interface type; its main use-case is
    as a function parameter type. When QStringViews are used as automatic
    variables or data members, care must be taken to ensure that the referenced
    string data (for example, owned by a QString) outlives the QStringView on all code paths,
    lest the string view ends up referencing deleted data.

    When used as an interface type, QStringView allows a single function to accept
    a wide variety of UTF-16 string data sources. One function accepting QStringView
    thus replaces three function overloads (taking QString, QStringRef, and
    \c{(const QChar*, int)}), while at the same time enabling even more string data
    sources to be passed to the function, such as \c{u"Hello World"}, a \c char16_t
    string literal.

    QStringViews should be passed by value, not by reference-to-const:
    \code
    void myfun1(QStringView sv);        // preferred
    void myfun2(const QStringView &sv); // compiles and works, but slower
    \endcode

    If you want to give your users maximum freedom in what strings they can pass
    to your function, accompany the QStringView overload with overloads for

    \list
        \li \e QChar: this overload can delegate to the QStringView version:
            \code
            void fun(QChar ch) { fun(QStringView(&ch, 1)); }
            \endcode
            even though, for technical reasons, QStringView cannot provide a
            QChar constructor by itself.
        \li \e QString: if you store an unmodified copy of the string and thus would
            like to take advantage of QString's implicit sharing.
        \li QLatin1String: if you can implement the function without converting the
            QLatin1String to UTF-16 first; users expect a function overloaded on
            QLatin1String to perform strictly less memory allocations than the
            semantically equivalent call of the QStringView version, involving
            construction of a QString from the QLatin1String.
    \endlist

    QStringView can also be used as the return value of a function. If you call a
    function returning QStringView, take extra care to not keep the QStringView
    around longer than the function promises to keep the referenced string data alive.
    If in doubt, obtain a strong reference to the data by calling toString() to convert
    the QStringView into a QString.

    QStringView is a \e{Literal Type}, but since it stores data as \c{char16_t}, iteration
    is not \c constexpr (casts from \c{const char16_t*} to \c{const QChar*}, which is not
    allowed in \c constexpr functions). You can use an indexed loop and/or utf16() in
    \c constexpr contexts instead.

    \note We strongly discourage the use of QList<QStringView>,
    because QList is a very inefficient container for QStringViews (it would heap-allocate
    every element). Use QVector (or std::vector) to hold QStringViews instead.

    accepting data from \c{std::basic_string} without truncation. The Qt API functions,
    for example length(), return \c int, while the STL-compatible functions, for example
    size(), return \c size_type.
